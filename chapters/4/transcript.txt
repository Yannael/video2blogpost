would love nothing more than to be able to feed raw bite sequences into uh language models in fact there's a paper about how this could potentially be done uh from Summer last last year now the problem is you actually have to go in and you have to modify the Transformer architecture because as I mentioned you're going to have a problem where the attention will start to become extremely expensive because the sequences are so long and so in this paper they propose kind of a hierarchical structuring of the Transformer that could allow you to just feed in raw bites and so at the end they say together these results establish the viability of tokenization free autor regressive sequence modeling at scale so tokenization free would indeed be amazing we would just feed B streams directly into our models but unfortunately I don't know that this has really been proven out yet by sufficiently many groups and a sufficient scale uh but something like this at one point would be amazing and I hope someone comes up with it but for now we have to come back and we can't feed this directly into language models and we have to compress it using the B paare encoding algorithm so let's see how that works so as I mentioned the B
