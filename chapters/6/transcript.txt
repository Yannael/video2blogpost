what I did I went to this block post that I enjoyed and I took the first paragraph and I copy pasted it here into text so this is one very long line here now to get the tokens as I mentioned we just take our text and we encode it into utf8 the tokens here at this point will be a raw bites single stream of bytes and just so that it's easier to work with instead of just a bytes object I'm going to convert all those bytes to integers and then create a list of it just so it's easier for us to manipulate and work with in Python and visualize and here I'm printing all of that so this is the original um this is the original paragraph and its length is 533 uh code points and then here are the bytes encoded in ut utf8 and we see that this has a length of 616 bytes at this point or 616 tokens and the reason this is more is because a lot of these simple asky characters or simple characters they just become a single bite but a lot of these Unicode more complex characters become multiple bytes up to four and so we are expanding that size so now what we'd like to do as a first step of the algorithm is we'd like to iterate over here and find the pair of bites that occur most frequently because we're then going to merge it so if you are working long on a notebook on a side then I encourage you to basically click on the link find this notebook and try to write that function yourself otherwise I'm going to come here and Implement first the function that finds the most common pair okay so here's what
