#  Considerations for Setting Vocabulary Size in Language Models

When designing the vocabulary size for a language model like GPT, there are several important factors to consider:

## Impact on Embedding Table and Final Linear Layer

The vocabulary size directly impacts the size of the token embedding table and the final linear layer (LM head) in the model architecture:

- The token embedding table is a 2D array where each row represents a learnable vector for a token in the vocabulary. As the vocab size increases, the number of rows (and parameters) in this table grows.

- The final linear layer produces logits/probabilities for the next token. With more tokens, it needs to output more probabilities, increasing the computation in this layer.

## Potential Undertraining of Parameters

As the vocabulary size grows very large (e.g. millions of tokens), each individual token will appear more rarely in the training data. This could lead to the corresponding embedding vectors being undertrained due to participating in the forward/backward pass less frequently.

## Sequence Length Considerations  

Larger vocabularies allow for more aggressive tokenization, encoding more characters per token on average. While this is beneficial for attending to longer contexts, it also means larger chunks of information are compressed into each token. The model may not have sufficient capacity in its forward pass to fully process the dense encodings.

## Extending a Pre-trained Model's Vocabulary

It's common to extend a pre-trained model with additional special tokens, e.g. for fine-tuning or adding tool-specific functionality. This requires minor model surgery:

1. Resize the token embedding table by adding new rows initialized with small random values.

2. Extend the final linear layer's weight matrix to produce logits for the added tokens. 

3. Optionally freeze the base model's parameters and only train the newly introduced ones.

The vocabulary size is an important empirical hyperparameter in language model design. Current state-of-the-art models typically use vocab sizes in the high tens or hundreds of thousands. Careful consideration of the above factors is needed to choose an appropriate value for a given application.
